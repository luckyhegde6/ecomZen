# Code Generation Guidelines

## Principles
1. **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Components**: Use React functional components with named exports.
3. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Avoid inline styles.
4. **Clean Code**: Follow SOLID principles. Keep components small and focused.
5. **Data Fetching**: Use Server Actions or API routes for data mutations. Use Server Components for data fetching where possible.

## Format
Provide code in separate blocks for each file. Include a brief explanation of the changes.
